# Random-Walker

Random walks let us model some stochastic events, like stock market prices or genetic drift, which have random movement. According to Wikipedia, the greatest source in the world, they've been around since 1905.

Looks pretty funky doesn't it? 

## Uniform Distribution
The random walker decides where to move using a function that samples from a uniform distribution. If our random walker sampled from a different distribution, we could make the walker trend in a particular direction. A different distribution could be useful, for example, if we needed to model an event where we had some background information suggesting a bias in a direction.

## Another Example

Let's say we want to use a random walk to model the price of that hyped-up cryptocurrency before you invested in it. The price is going up, because of course it is. It might look something like this.

But let's see what happens after you invest in it.

Wow! Looks like it wasn't worth buying was it?
