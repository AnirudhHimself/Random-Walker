# Random-Walker

Random walks let us model some stochastic events, like stock market prices or genetic drift, which have random movement. According to Wikipedia, the greatest source in the world, they've been around since 1905.

Looks pretty funky doesn't it? 

## Uniform Distribution
The Random Walk decides where to go using a function that samples from a uniform distribution. If our random walker sampled from a different distribution, we could make the walker trend in a particular direction. A different distribution could be useful, for example, if we needed to model an event where we had background information about trends.
